# Comprehensive Guide to React Core Concepts

This guide covers the essential React concepts you need to understand for building modern applications using React. Below are the explanations of functional components, props, state, hooks, and more, along with code examples.

---

## 1. **Functional Components**

Functional components are the simplest and most common way to write React components. They are JavaScript functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML). Functional components have become the preferred method since the introduction of hooks.

### Key Features:

- Simpler syntax compared to class components.
- Can use hooks to manage state, lifecycle features, and more.
- Better performance and optimization.
- Easier to test and maintain.

### Code Example:

```javascript
import React from "react";

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to React</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Greeting;
```

## 2. **Props (Properties)**

Props are inputs passed to components from their parent component. They are read-only and are used to make components reusable.

### Key Features:

- Passed from parent to child.
- Immutable inside the component (cannot be modified).
- Can be any data type (strings, numbers, objects, functions).

### Code Example:

```javascript
// Parent Component
const App = () => {
  return <UserProfile name="John Doe" age={25} />;
};

// Child Component
const UserProfile = ({ name, age }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## 3. **State in React**

State is mutable data managed within a component. State changes trigger re-renders, allowing the UI to update dynamically.

### Key Features:

- Managed internally within the component.
- Mutable and can be updated using `useState` (functional components) or `setState` (class components).
- Changes to state trigger re-renders.

### Code Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

## 4. **State vs Props**

| Feature        | Props                          | State                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Control**    | Controlled by parent component | Controlled internally                  |
| **Mutability** | Immutable (cannot be modified) | Mutable (can be modified)              |
| **Re-render**  | Re-render when parent changes  | Re-render when state changes           |
| **Usage**      | Pass data from parent to child | Manage local data within the component |

## 5. **Refs in React**

Refs allow direct access to DOM nodes or React elements. They are used for handling focus, text selection, or triggering imperative animations. Refs don't cause re-renders when accessed or modified.

### Use Cases:

- Managing focus or text selection.
- Triggering imperative animations.
- Integrating with third-party libraries or APIs.

### Code Example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";

const AutoFocusInput = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    inputRef.current?.focus(); // Focus the input when component mounts
  }, []);

  return <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />;
};

export default AutoFocusInput;
```

## 6. **Context API**

The Context API allows you to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling, making it easier to manage global data (such as themes or user authentication).

### Key Features:

- Avoids prop drilling by allowing you to pass data directly through the component tree.
- Ideal for global state like themes or user authentication.
- Can be consumed by any child component.

### Code Example:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

// Create context
const ThemeContext = createContext("light");

// Provider Component
const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};

// Consumer Component
const ThemedButton = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}>
      Switch to {theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"} theme
    </button>
  );
};

export default ThemeProvider;
```

## 7. **React Hooks**

Hooks are functions that allow you to use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features inside functional components. Some common hooks are:

- **useState**: Manage state.
- **useEffect**: Handle side effects (e.g., data fetching).
- **useContext**: Access context data.
- **useRef**: Keep mutable references.
- **useMemo/useCallback**: Optimize performance.

### Code Example using `useState` and `useEffect`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((json) => setData(json));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means it runs once after the first render

  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : "Loading..."}</div>;
};

export default DataFetcher;
```

## Summary of Key Concepts

- **Functional Components**: A simpler and more modern way to define React components.
- **Props**: Immutable data passed from parent to child components.
- **State**: Mutable data that triggers re-renders when updated.
- **State vs Props**: State is internal to the component, while props come from the parent.
- **Refs**: Used to access DOM elements or mutable data without triggering re-renders.
- **Context API**: Enables global state management and avoids prop drilling.
- **React Hooks**: Functions that provide state and lifecycle features in functional components.

These core concepts form the foundation of React, enabling you to build powerful and dynamic web applications with ease.
